Monolith 🌌

Monolith is a smart library provider for Playnite designed to find the games other scanners simply ignore. Whether it’s a DRM-free title, a standalone indie gem, or a backup from your "personal archives" with a messy folder name, Monolith digs deep to identify and import them with clean, metadata-ready names. It’s built to turn a chaotic directory of standalone copies into a polished, console-like collection without the manual headache.
Key Features

    Finds Everything: Scans sub-directories to detect standalone games and archives that official launchers won't track.

    Clean Names, Every Time: Uses custom Regex to strip away noise like "Repack," "v1.0," "Shipping," or "GOG Edition," turning messy names into clean titles like Subnautica or Cyberpunk 2077.

    Heuristic Engine: Prioritizes .exe names over directory names to ensure a 100% metadata match on IGDB.

    Smart Fallback: If an executable name is a cryptic abbreviation (like tlou_i.exe), it automatically pulls the title from the parent folder instead.

    Built-in Blacklist: Automatically skips system tools, DirectX folders, and updaters to keep your library clutter-free.

Usage

    Install the Monolith plugin in Playnite.

    Go to Add-ons -> Extension Settings -> Monolith.

    Add your game root folders (e.g., D:\Games or E:\Backups).

    Update your library and let the engine do the cleaning.

Technical Details

    Language: C#

    Framework: .NET Framework 4.6.2 (Playnite SDK Standard)

    Logic:

        Implements an Order of Operations fix: Cleans version/group tags before removing punctuation to maintain regex accuracy.

        PascalCase Splitting: Automatically turns TheLastOfUs into The Last Of Us for better API matching.

        Heuristic Scoring: Validates game folders based on file signatures and excludes known non-game executables.
